# Grid-maze RL with Configurable Hyperparameters
> This project was created as a supporting software for my research work on [PME ITB](https://pme.itb.ac.id/)

A python script of the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm in a grid world environment. The script can perform multiple runs of RL simulation based on user-defined sets of hyperparameters and environment configurations.

The main file is `main.ipynb`. Details on how to run the file can be read inside the file itself.

## Files Description
- `main.ipynb` — The main script file
- `lib` — Folder containing custom libraries used in `main.ipynb`
- `maze_config` — Folder containing grid-maze environment configuration files generated from [this script](https://github.com/rydhslmy/RL_Sim)
- `temp` — A dump folder used by `main.ipynb`
